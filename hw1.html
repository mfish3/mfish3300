3. 
    Type Coercion means that when JavaScript is presented with different types, it will change and cast one of them into the other type, so that it can do an operation.
'1'+ 1. In JavaScript this would result in '11', but in Python this would result in a typeError. JavaScript changes the number 1 into a string and then concatenates the two strings, whereas Python would throw an error
'1' + true. In JavaScript this would result in '1true', but in Python this would result in a typeError. JavaScript changes the Boolean into a string and concatenates the two strings, whereas Python would throw an error.
    <script>
 console.log('1' + 1);
console.log('1' + True);
 </script>

    4. All late work receives a zero. If I submit something that is not compressed, has wrong files, or is missing files, I will get a zero. You get 5 slip days.
